To compile: javac *.java

To run: java Test

Be sure to run "java Test" in the hw4_original directory, otherwise the
program will not be able to find its images.

New functionality:

-   Added adapter pattern to support RedSprite. The new red sprite travels straight until
    reaching the canvas boundary, where it turns 90 degrees counterclockwise to continue traveling.

-   Added strategy pattern to allow the 4 sprites user control when they are highlighted,
    excluding the RedSprite. The sprites stop moving when they become highlighted, and when
    they become highlighted, their original direction from before they became highlighted
    is restored.

-   new MoveType attribute which represents which movement strategy will be used by a given sprite

-   MovementBehavior interface added along with three concrete strategies:
    ConcreteMoveAuto, ConcreteMoveControl, and ConcreteMoveRedSprite
